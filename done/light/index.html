<h1 id="tekst2">EDITION 11</h1>
<h3 id="tekst">During the eleventh edition we take you on a journey to the world of imagination. Get inspired by the twenty light artworks against the backdrop of Amsterdam and Imagine Beyond.
    IMAGINE BEYOND
The world around us is temporary and can seem very different in an instance; we have all experience this just very recently. However, the power of our imagination remains! 
With imagination we can exceed the here and now, to imagine the day of tomorrow however we want. Let the artworks carry you to different worlds. Look through the light and let your fantasy run wild. What do you see? Are we talking to lamps? 
Do we only have virtual bridges? Does the water flow up? Join us on this journey and experience it for yourself!
