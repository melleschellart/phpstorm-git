It is set in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and its surrounding areas, influenced by the Wizarding World franchise. The player can explore familiar locations such as Hogsmeade and the Forbidden Forest. One of the main elements for the player is to attend classes. Each of the four known Hogwarts Houses—Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin—also offers a unique common room; these rooms are only accessible for the player's current house chosen by the Sorting Hat. Accompanied by the choice of house, the player receives different exclusive quests. Progressing through the game sees the interior and exterior of the castle change visually to match the seasons. The game also features changing music based on the location of the player character, as they move through the open world, with notable differences within the specific common rooms that can only be accessed by players who choose each corresponding school house.</p>
